# VLSI_CA2
1. The vcd_parser.py generates the answer to the first part of problem 1. But the testbench written in verilog must be executed first 
to generate vcd file.
2. The main1.py generates the answers to the second part of the problem 1.
3. main2.py generates the second problem's answer. It may take a while!
